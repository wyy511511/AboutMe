# Combining Interactive Network Graph with Discourse Forum Framework for Blogging

Lunasol 

## Introduction:
My personal website implemented the integration of an interactive network graph created using D3.js with the deployment of the Discourse open-source forum framework as a blogging platform. The network graph allows users to click on each node, redirecting them to the corresponding tag summary page on the blog.

## Why Choose Discourse for Blogging?
There are several reasons why Discourse was chosen as the framework for hosting the blog:

Rich Text Editor and Edit History:

Editing content in real-time on the web is much more convenient than traditional blogging, where markdown is written locally and then uploaded.
Categories and Tags Management:

Discourse provides efficient management of categories and tags, making it easier to organize and navigate content.
Excellent UI and Interactivity:

Discourse offers a user-friendly interface with customizable branding options.
It displays external links in a card-style format, enhancing the user experience.
When browsing through numerous posts with thousands of replies, Discourse's smooth scrolling and interaction make navigation seamless. Users don't need to jump between pages 1 to 55 manually.
Easy Backup and Server Migration:

Discourse simplifies the process of creating backups and migrating to different servers.
User Engagement:

Registered readers can leave comments and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of community and interaction.
